# Machine Learning Stroke Risk
This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning modeling document for analyzing and predicting stroke risk. The goal is to use predictive modeling to identify key factors contributing to stroke risk and create a robust model to assist in early detection and prevention.

The project is structured to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and usability, providing insights for healthcare professionals, data scientists, and researchers.

This semester long project was completed by my partner and I during the Fall 2022 semester.

Features:

Data Preparation: Cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering for stroke-related datasets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical summaries, visualizations, and correlation analysis to uncover key patterns.

Modeling: Implementation of multiple machine learning models, including decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, clustering, anomaly analysis, association rules, and neural networks.
